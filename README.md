## What is HortGenome Search Engine (HSE)
The [HortGenome Search Engine](http://hort.moilab.net/) is a universal search engine that allows querying genes, functional annotations, and homologous gene pairs for hundreds of genomes of horticultural crops.

## Issue tracking system 
Due to the rapid advances in sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, new genomes are constantly being developed. Therefore, HSE is frequently updated, leading to potential inconsistencies in the species represented in different parts and error information of HSE. So, we are utilizing an online ticketing system (through GitHub) to facilitate timely feedback on any potential inconsistencies in HSE. Additionally, we welcome users to use this system to make suggestions for HSE improvements

### open an issue
Please open this page [https://github.com/kentnf/HSE/issues](https://github.com/kentnf/HSE/issues) and click the new issue button.

Before submitting a new question, we strongly recommend checking through this system to see if the same question has been asked before.

### Submit new genome
We strongly recommend using the [Genome Collection Form](https://forms.gle/B1bPLBemD9f736Nw6) to submit a new genome if you are familiar with it. You need to submit the correct scientific name, common name, publication, download links for genome sequences, gene annotation files, and other required information.

If you do not know much about the submitted genome, you cannot be sure whether it has been included by HSE. You can use the [issue tracking system](https://github.com/kentnf/HSE/issues) to open an issue and provide the relevant article or download link. We will search the species' genome based on the information you provide.

If the genome you want to submit encounters some special circumstances, for example, the relevant genome article has not been published yet, you can contact us directly. Contact information, email: yz [at] moilab.net.
